Stuff (Simple CLI Password Manager)
=======================

Stuff is a Python library for managing your own passwords in a CLI-based manner.

## Description

This library was first created to satisfy my own needs of handling my passwords. Because
I tend to change my passwords pretty frequently I usually find myself in a position of 
having to reset them kinda often.
